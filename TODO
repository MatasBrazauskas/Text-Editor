organize the class and file diagram for better future development: https://app.diagrams.net/#G1ugAFxZv7-sgiCDt967-2PoCORqRixp9M#%7B%22pageId%22%3A%22C5RBs43oDa-KdzZeNtuy%22%7D
create the steps for progress of a project, roadmap.
orgranize features.

Erros in the code:

I need to check what system the used has : Windows or Linux/macOS. Then I need to run the gcc compiler on files, store information in a hashmap what stores key as file name and 
value as array of stucts. Error struct contains:
* size_t row, size_t column, char[] errorMess
I need to use the -o flag in the gcc compiler for fast compilation time for all of a files in the project. Because if I change one part of a file, the errors could fix itself.
I will use the CMAKE file, that I will need to update every time I add files to the current project, so that I would get all errors in the build. Would need to use the '-fanalyzer'
flag on gcc compiler. I would display:
errors, warnings , notes and analyzer features.

Command line area:
I want to use the VIM motions and a command line command to interact with the text editor.

File area:
I just need to display or update the file area if a user interacts with the files in a directory. Rerender then needed.

Control class:
Used to control the class and file work flow. It will be used to 'lend' information to other classes - text and command line areas. Those classes will only get the current text
inputted into a keyword and those classes will have to parse and use the information accordingly.

Text area:
I need to load the files that the user has now opened. I need to use the SDL_TTF library use the different fonts to display text on screen. I also need to implament a whole nother 
class to store the font texture, whole text editor color that would need to be read from a file and easily accsed.
