create the steps for progress of a project, roadmap.
orgranize features.

Erros in the code:
I need to check what system the used has : Windows or Linux/macOS. Then I need to run the gcc compiler on files, store information in a hashmap what stores key as file name and 
value as array of stucts. Error struct contains:
* size_t row, size_t column, char[] errorMess
I need to use the -o flag in the gcc compiler for fast compilation time for all of a files in the project. Because if I change one part of a file, the errors could fix itself.
