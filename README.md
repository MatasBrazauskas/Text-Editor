# Custom Text Editor with Vim Motions

Welcome to my custom text editor project! ðŸŽ‰  

## *About*  
This is a personal project where I am building a text editor using C++ and SDL. The editor includes Vim-like motions and features, providing a customizable experience for editing text. Through this project, I aim to:  
- Develop a text editor that supports basic text editing functions.  
- Integrate Vim-style motions for efficient navigation.  
- Enhance my understanding of C++ programming and SDL.

## Goals  
- Build a fully functional text editor.  
- Implement Vim-style motions, such as navigation using `h`, `j`, `k`, `l`, and other Vim commands.  
- Gain experience with C++ and SDL for GUI development.  
- Support additional features like syntax highlighting, error display, and multiple file support.

## Features  
- **Vim-like Motion Support**: Navigate text like you would in Vim using `h`, `j`, `k`, `l`, and other Vim keys.  
- **Text Editing**: Add, remove, and modify text in a flexible, user-friendly environment.  
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Highlight different programming languages with color coding for better readability.  
- **Multi-file Support**: Open, edit, and save multiple files at once.  
- **Error Display**: Show compilation errors in an integrated errors area to help with debugging.

## *Text Editor Overview*

### 1. Window and Layout  
The editorâ€™s window is created using SDL, with support for different platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS). The interface is divided into distinct areas:  

- **Text Area**: Where the content is displayed and edited. This area allows you to type, modify, and navigate your text.
  
- **Command Line Area**: For Vim-style commands and input. Here, you can perform actions like saving (`:w`), quitting (`:q`), and other text editing operations.

- **File Area**: To manage and switch between open files. You can easily open new files and navigate through them in this area.

- **Errors Area**: For displaying compiler errors when using a C++ file. This area shows you detailed error messages and allows you to navigate directly to the lines with issues.

### 2. Vim Motions and Commands  
The text editor supports common Vim motions, such as:  
- **Arrow keys**: Move the cursor up, down, left, or right.  
- **`h`, `j`, `k`, `l`**: Navigate the text (left, down, up, right).  
- **`gg`**: Move to the beginning of the file.  
- **`G`**: Move to the end of the file.  
- **`w`, `b`**: Move between words.  
- **`d`, `y`, `p`**: Cut, copy, and paste text.  

The editor also supports more advanced Vim commands like `:w` for saving, `:q` for quitting, and more.

### 3. Syntax Highlighting  
The editor highlights keywords, variables, and syntax in different colors to improve readability and make the code easier to follow. Syntax highlighting is applied based on file type (e.g., C++, Python, etc.), and it can be extended to support more languages.

### 4. Error Display  
When editing code (like C++), the editor parses compilation errors and displays them in the Errors Area. This allows you to quickly navigate between errors and fix them in the editor.

### 5. Multi-file Support  
You can open, close, and switch between multiple files. The File Area shows all open files and allows you to quickly jump between them without losing your place.

### 6. Cross-Platform Support  
The editor is designed to work on multiple platforms, including Windows, Linux, and macOS, using SDL for rendering. 

### 7. Command Line Area  
The Command Line Area is integrated with Vim commands, allowing you to perform actions such as saving files, opening new files, and searching through the document with a few keystrokes.
